        I'm Jesse Siekkinen and I'm studying information technology at JAMK University of Applied Sciences (<a href="http://www.jamk.fi">jamk.fi</a>).
        My intention is to graduate in four years with bachelor of engineering in information technology.
        I have had information technology (and computers in general) as a hobby for long time now and I have strong interest in it.
        Previosly I studied as electrician and automation technician.
        You can find more about my education and degrees at the <a href="/en/education/">education</a> page.

        At first sight my hobbies seems to have all from very different fields.
        When you look more closely at them, however, you'll see that technology (which is actually pretty large field...) is the common thing in all those.
        Examples of my hobbies are programming, web-coding and other computer related stuff, photography, radio technology, show technology and playing of piano.
        More of my hobbies you can find at the <a href="/en/hobbies/">hobbies</a> page

        From these pages you can also find links from other pages and to homepages of applications I like to use.
        My contact information lays at the <a href="/en/about/">about</a> page.
        This website was at first made as a assignment for WEB-course, so materials and documentation made for that is also available here (only in finnish though).
