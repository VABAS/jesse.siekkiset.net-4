        Show technology refers to sound and lighting solutions made for stage
        performances and shows. I would also count projections and staging into
        show technology field. I myself have done mainly lighting and sounds in
        theatre environment since spring 2013. I Started as lighting operator
        and have recently moved towards lighting design. My hand print could
        have been seen since fall 2015 and my first "own" lighting design was
        for <i>Siperian nuorisoteatteri</i> at December 2015 for <i>Uhka
        mediasta</i> production.

        <p>
        It's very common in these days to have photography as hobby, so I count it as my hobby also. I have few principles when I'm photographing:
        </p>
        <ul class="lista_kamera">
            <li>Try to take as ready pictures as possible. Meaning, try to avoid necessity of image manipulation later</li>
            <li>Understand how the camera works</li>
            <li>Plan photo shootings, environments and other affecting factors before hand if possible</li>
            <li>Also, becouse we're at digital time: try out your ideas!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        These princibles apply only when I'm photographing as hobby.
        If I must capture an important moment I just try to capture those moments.
        It doesn't matter if I have to turn every knob up to maximum to receive eligible outcome.
        <br/>I have gathered few of the best photos I have taken or have been taking into <a href="/en/imagepage/">here</a>
